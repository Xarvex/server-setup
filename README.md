# Server Setup

Various setup scripts I use for configuring settings and programs on a server.
Made for a [Debian]-based system.

Main repository lives on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/xarvex/server-setup).
Mirror can be found through [GitHub](https://github.com/Xarvex/server-setup).


## Usage

These scripts are consistently changing and adapting based on needs and
improvements, and should not be relied on as a library.
See this more as a dump, meant to be ran once for that initial setup.

Each script is numbered based off the typical order they would be ran.
If one script depends on another or some setting, I try to make that clear.


## Prerequisites

- [Debian]-based distribution (only tested on Debian 12 stable)
